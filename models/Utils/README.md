# v_usp_fix(BMP_Reference_Model)

This file serves as the reference model for creating other skins with consistent measurements. It defines the standard BMP dimensions and layout used for skin design.

### Instructions:

Use this BMP as the base for creating new skins.
Ensure all skins match the defined dimensions and layout to maintain consistency across designs.
The template may be copied and modified, but the core measurements must remain unchanged.
Important Notes:

Any changes in dimensions may result in incompatibility with the system or design guidelines.
Save the new skins with unique names to differentiate them from the reference model.
